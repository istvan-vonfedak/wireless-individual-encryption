Wireless Individual Encryption aims to become a standard security protocol for establishing encrypted communication and identification between internet access points and personal computers in online communication. The usage of WIE technology ensures that all data transmitted between the access point and the computer remains encrypted. The need for this is evident in the wide use of open wifi networks. Our engineering approach is to authenticate true wifi networks with a Certificate Authority. The list of trusted wifis will be held on the device, and when a new wifi is found WIE will check if this new wifi has been certified by the CA server.
